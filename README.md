# Overview
**Operank Scheduling** is a system for scheduling patients' surgeries, while optimizing the hospital's timetable. 

The system was developed as part of a final project in Electrical Engineering, Tel-Aviv University, in collaboration with the Tel-Aviv 'Souraski' Medical Center (Ichilov Hospital).

Using an XGBoost prediction model trained on real data, along with an optimization approach with Google-OR's CP-SAT solver, the system achieved an **increase of 25% in operating room utilization** and a subsequent **increase of 40% in the amount of surgeries scheduled** per unit of time - in comparison with the current schedules of Tel-Aviv 'Souraski' Medical Center.
